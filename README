# imap-quota

To use, create a systems.property file with the following entries (see properties.sample):

imap_server=[FQDN for imap email server]
imap_username=[full login username for email server - might be the email address]
imap_password=[login password for email server]
imap_quota=[percentage of quota to check as a float, i.e. 68.0]

Compile source with maven:

$ mvn clean package

Run code:

java -jar -DpropFile=/path/to/system.properties [-Doutput=true] /path/to/imap-quota-1.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Optional output parameter will display quota information to stdout:

Prop File: /Users/djames/Code/Java/imap-quota/resources/system.properties
	Server: mail.speakeasy.net - Username: djames@speakeasy.net - Threshold: 68.00
Speakeasy Quota: 659,715 of 1,048,678 (62.91%)

Whether or not the output is true or false, if the email storage is higher than the quota, an
email will be sent to the account specified warning about the quota. The idea is that this should
be called via cron on a regular basis to keep email usage from exceeding quota causing email
receipt to be blocked.
